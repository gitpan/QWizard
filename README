MODULE

  QWizard - A Question and Answer Wizard

DESCRIPTION

  The QWizard module allows script authors to concentrate on the content
  of the forms they want their users to fill in without worrying about
  the display.  It allows "Question Wizard" like interfaces to be very
  easily created and the results of the input easily acted upon.
  Scripts written which are entirely based on QWizard inputs are able to
  be run from the command line which will show a Tk window or as a CGI
  script without modification.  Script writers do not need to know which
  interface is being used to display the resulting form(s) as it should
  be transparent to the script itself.

  Other wizard interfaces exist for perl, but this one strives very
  hard to be both extensible and easy to code with requiring as little
  work by script authors as possible.  It is also one of the only ones
  that supports both web environments and windowing environments
  without code modification required by the script author.

PREREQUISITES

  In order to make use of the different environments that QWizard can
  support, you should have at least one of the following module sets
  installed:

  Web based scripts:
    CGI                      # (common with all perl these days)
    CGI::Cookie

  Tk based graphical scripts:
    Tk
    Tk::Table
    Tk::FileSelect
    Tk::Tree                 # optional
    Tk::PNG                  # optional (for image support)

  CLI support (very minimal):
    Term::ReadLine

  Additional features available if the modules are available:
    GD::Graph                # graphing support

HISTORY

  QWizard was originally developed within the Net-Policy network
  management system but was later made to be a separate system and is
  now used in other applications as well.  Specifically, Net-Policy
  had serious issues for a while trying to keep track of state between
  long series of user input screens using the standard CGI package,
  and the QWizard system was developed specifically to combat this
  problem.  Net-Policy is still built on top of it making heavy use of
  the QWizard system and offers both a HTML and a Tk network
  management interface using the same code base.

FUTURE WORK

  A Gtk2 interface is nearly complete, as is a curses and WAP (cell
  phone) interface.  Once complete existing applications will not need
  to be modified to make these interfaces work with the newer
  infrastructure underneath them.
