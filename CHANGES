3.14:
  HTML Generator:
    - defaults to using minimal included css
    - the "nocss" option can turn this off
    - file downloads supported, though it currently creates the file
      at screen creation time and thus can't be affected by parameter
      changes on the current screen, unlike other backends...

  - Misc other bug fixes
